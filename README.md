The DriverPass project was from a company who teaches driving lessons. They wanted a website where they could sell packages and schedule appointments online.
I think I did well with most of the diagrams and requirements. 
I would revise my class diagram because I am not sure I did it right and I probably left some stuff out.
I added features that the user felt that they needed, and ones that would make it easier for them to do their jobs, like being able to disable packages and see appointment times. It is important to include what the user needs, because if you don't meet their needs, no one will use the website. 
When programming, you start big picture, and then break it down into smaller parts. This way you can see the main functionality of the project and work into the specifics of the code and features.
