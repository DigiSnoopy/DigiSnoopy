How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating ‚Äúuser stories‚Äù help with this?
I interpret user needs and implement by always considering what the user would want and using their input to design the product. Creating user stories helps us to know exactly what the users are looking for in the program and how important they think certain features are.
How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I hope to be able to incorporate the information raditor into my future development work because I think communication is key when you are working on a large project.
